<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a project done by Ferran De La Varga Antoja in
<a href="https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/stu11001-software-applications-i/" target="_blank">
STU11001 – Software Applications I</a> Semester 1 2022-2023, Trinity College 
Dublin, using Microsoft Expression Web 4.</p>
<p>In this page, I'm going to explain very briefly how I've made the website and 
how I have developed the features required.</p>
<h2>Features required</h2>
<h4>1. formatting (Arial, font size 12; margins: 30px side, 20px top and bottom; 
a few headings)</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">This format has been applied in quiz.html page.</p>
<h4><br />
2. table (apply different background for a better view; merge some rows/columns; 
align text to left and centre; autofit to content to adjust column width 
automatically)</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">In 4.Main sights, barcelona.html, there's a table. 
Autofit is enabled.</p>
<h4><br />
3. image (wrap text around the image to enclose the image)</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">In 1.Description and 2.Geography there's a Photo 
surrounded by text.</p>
<h4>4. anchor link</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">In barcelona.html, there's an index. If a section of the 
index is clicked it will redirect to the corresponding section (heading) in the 
page.</p>
<h4><br />
5. mailto link</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">At the end of barcelona.html, contact section.</p>
<h4><br />
6. text link to external site</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">Multiple links to external sites are found in almost all 
pages, being in the text, in the bibliography or in the images of the table.</p>
<h4><br />
7. irregular hotspot</h4>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">In quiz.html there's a game for identifying in a 
Barcelona's map the Sagrada Família. I've enabled the option to have a unique 
cursor for not finding the answer by simply looking at how the cursor could have changed when 
crossing the irregular hotspot. The cursor displayed in the hole map is called 
"crosshair" and has been added in the &lt;style&gt; section of the html.<br />
There's a button that when clicked the picture changes to the picture with the 
solution.<br />
If the user finds the solution (clicks the Sagrada Família) it is redirected to 
the quiz_correct.html page.</p>
<h4><br />
8. disjointed rollover</h4>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">Once in quiz_correct.html, the user can 
give feedback. For now feedback given by the user is not taken into account. There are two 
small gif emojis (happy and sad) and a bigger one (neutral). If the user mouse 
over one small emoji, the emoji pointed by the mouse will be reflected in the 
bigger one (disjointed rollover).<br />
When a small emoji is clicked a message appears saying thank you and the big 
emoji stays fixed depending on the feedback sent.</p>
<h4><br />
9. navigation (each page has links to all the other pages)</h4>
<p class="auto-style1">Yes. Normally at the bottom of each page.</p>
<h4><br />
10. form</h4>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">Located in the Contact section at the bottom of 
barcleona.html. You can reset the form or submit the form (send an email with 
the answers). Note that the message is not an "input" type, it is a "textarea". 
I've used this type for having the text wrapped and also, now, the text written can be seen properly because 
the text box can be made larger or smaller by the user, depending 
on if he wants to add a short or a large message.</p>
<h4><br />
11. Javascript</h4>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">In quiz_correct.html, there's a button that, when 
clicked, the exact time and date is displayed through a message.<br />
The main page (index.html), displays the button for going to the barcelona.html 
5 seconds after the index.html page has loaded. <br />
</p>
<h2 align="justify">Responsive Web Design and others</h2>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">For justifying the text, I've used: 
align="justify".</p>
<p align="justify" class="auto-style1">All pages follow the Responsive Web 
Design principle. All html pages can be resized and all the content (text, 
images, tables, etc.) will be resized for being fit in the new viewport. That 
means that this website can be accessed through tablets and mobile phones 
because the content is auto-resized. <br />
For configure it I have made a little modification in &lt;meta&gt; and for each 
picture added, the size is not defined in pixels but in percentage. The only 
image that is not expressed in percentage is the map of the quiz because I've 
seen that in small screens the map couldn't be seen properly.</p>
