# HTML & JavaScript 
## Design and develop a web site using Microsoft Expression Web 4
This is an assignment I've done in [STU11001 â€“ Software Applications I](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/stu11001-software-applications-i/) module during Semester 1 2022-2023, Trinity College Dublin (Computer Science and Statistics School), using Microsoft Expression Web 4.

All the requirements can be found in [2022_A2.pdf](./2022_A2.pdf).

Text and images are taken from different sites from the internet and the reference of those are specified in the Bibliography sections of the .html files.

**Final mark: 95 out of 100.**

The only little mistake was that the javascript requirement is not fully acomplished: the webpage already loads upon the alert - when the message is displayed, the background of the page should be blank.
