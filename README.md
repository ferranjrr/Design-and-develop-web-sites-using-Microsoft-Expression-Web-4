# Design-and-develop-web-sites-using-Microsoft-Expression-Web-4
This is a project done by Ferran De La Varga Antoja in [STU11001 â€“ Software Applications I Semester 1 2022-2023](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/stu11001-software-applications-i/), Trinity College Dublin (Computer Science and Statistics School), using Microsoft Expression Web 4.

All images are taken from the internet and the reference of those are specified in the Bibliography sections in the .html files.

In 2022_A2 can be seen the requirements.

#### To do:
Put the all the images in one folder for having a more cleared structure.

**Final mark: 95 out of 100.**

The mistake was that in the javascript requirement, the webpage already loads upon the alert, and when the message is displayed, the background of the page should be blank.
